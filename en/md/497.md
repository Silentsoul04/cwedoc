# ID: 497 - Exposure of System Data to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
<h5>Name</h5>Exposure of System Data to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
<h5>Weakness</h5>Variant
<h5>Status</h5>Incomplete
<h5>Description</h5>Exposing system data or debugging information helps an adversary learn about the system and form an attack plan.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>An information exposure occurs when system data or debugging information leaves the program through an output stream or logging function that makes it accessible to unauthorized parties. An attacker can also cause errors to occur by submitting unusual requests to the web application. The response to these errors can reveal detailed system information, deny service, cause security mechanisms to fail, and crash the server. An attacker can use error messages that reveal technologies, operating systems, and product versions to tune the attack against known vulnerabilities in these technologies. An application may use diagnostic methods that provide significant implementation details such as stack traces as part of its error handling mechanism.

<h5>PotentialMitigations</h5>::PHASE:Architecture and Design Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Production applications should never use methods that generate internal details such as stack traces and error messages unless that information is directly committed to a log that is not viewable by the end user. All error message text should be HTML entity encoded before being written to the log file to protect against potential cross-site scripting attacks against the viewer of the logs::
