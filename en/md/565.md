# ID: 565 - Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking
<h5>Name</h5>Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking
<h5>Weakness</h5>Base
<h5>Status</h5>Incomplete
<h5>Description</h5>The application relies on the existence or values of cookies when performing security-critical operations, but it does not properly ensure that the setting is valid for the associated user.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>Attackers can easily modify cookies, within the browser or by implementing the client-side code outside of the browser. Reliance on cookies without detailed validation and integrity checking can allow attackers to bypass authentication, conduct injection attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting, or otherwise modify inputs in unexpected ways.

The cookie can be manipulated to escalate an attacker's privileges to an administrative level.::

<h5>PotentialMitigations</h5>::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Avoid using cookie data for a security-related decision.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Perform thorough input validation (i.e.: server side validation) on the cookie data if you're going to use it for a security related decision.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Add integrity checks to detect tampering.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Protect critical cookies from replay attacks, since cross-site scripting or other attacks may allow attackers to steal a strongly-encrypted cookie that also passes integrity checks. This mitigation applies to cookies that should only be valid during a single transaction or session. By enforcing timeouts, you may limit the scope of an attack. As part of your integrity check, use an unpredictable, server-side value that is not exposed to the client.::

<h5>Notes</h5>TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:This problem can be primary to many types of weaknesses in web applications. A developer may perform proper validation against URL parameters while assuming that attackers cannot modify cookies. As a result, the program might skip basic input validation to enable cross-site scripting, SQL injection, price tampering, and other attacks..::
