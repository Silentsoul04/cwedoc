# ID: 636 - Not Failing Securely ('Failing Open')
<h5>Name</h5>Not Failing Securely ('Failing Open')
<h5>Weakness</h5>Class
<h5>Status</h5>Draft
<h5>Description</h5>When the product encounters an error condition or failure, its design requires it to fall back to a state that is less secure than other options that are available, such as selecting the weakest encryption algorithm or using the most permissive access control restrictions.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>By entering a less secure state, the product inherits the weaknesses associated with that state, making it easier to compromise. At the least, it causes administrators to have a false sense of security. This weakness typically occurs as a result of wanting to fail functional to minimize administration and support costs, instead of failing safe.

<h5>ObservedExamples</h5>::REFERENCE:CVE-2007-5277:DESCRIPTION:The failure of connection attempts in a web browser resets DNS pin restrictions. An attacker can then bypass the same origin policy by rebinding a domain name to a different IP address. This was an attempt to fail functional.:LINK:https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5277REFERENCE:CVE-2006-4407:DESCRIPTION:Incorrect prioritization leads to the selection of a weaker cipher. Although it is not known whether this issue occurred in implementation or design, it is feasible that a poorly designed algorithm could be a factor.:LINK:https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4407

<h5>Notes</h5>TYPE:Research Gap:NOTE:Since design issues are hard to fix, they are rarely publicly reported, so there are few CVE examples of this problem as of January 2008. Most publicly reported issues occur as the result of an implementation error instead of design, such as CVE-2005-3177 (Improper handling of large numbers of resources) or CVE-2005-2969 (inadvertently disabling a verification step, leading to selection of a weaker protocol).::
