# ID: 96 - Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')
<h5>Name</h5>Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')
<h5>Weakness</h5>Base
<h5>Status</h5>Draft
<h5>Description</h5>The software receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.

<h5>CommonConsequences</h5>::SCOPE:Confidentiality:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Read Files or Directories Read Application Data:NOTE:Confidentiality Read Files or Directories Read Application Data The injected code could access restricted data / files.::SCOPE:Access Control:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:NOTE:Access Control Bypass Protection Mechanism In some cases, injectable code controls authentication; this may lead to a remote vulnerability.::SCOPE:Access Control:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity:NOTE:Access Control Gain Privileges or Assume Identity Injected code can access resources that the attacker is directly prevented from accessing.::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Other:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:NOTE:Integrity Confidentiality Availability Other Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands Code injection attacks can lead to loss of data integrity in nearly all cases as the control-plane data injected is always incidental to data recall or writing. Additionally, code injection can often result in the execution of arbitrary code.::SCOPE:Non-Repudiation:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Hide Activities:NOTE:Non-Repudiation Hide Activities Often the actions performed by injected control code are unlogged.::

<h5>PotentialMitigations</h5>::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY:Input Validation:EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Assume all input is malicious. Use an accept known good input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does. When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, boat may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as red or blue. Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). A blacklist is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY:Output Encoding:EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Perform proper output validation and escaping to neutralize all code syntax from data written to code files.::

<h5>Notes</h5>TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:HTML injection (see CWE-79: XSS) could be thought of as an example of this, but the code is injected and executed on the client side, not the server side. Server-Side Includes (SSI) are an example of direct static code injection.::
