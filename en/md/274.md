<h5>Notes</h5>TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:Overlaps dropped privileges, insufficient permissions.::::TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:This has a layering relationship with Unchecked Error Condition and Unchecked Return Value.::::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:CWE-280 and CWE-274 are too similar. It is likely that CWE-274 will be deprecated in the future.::::TYPE:Theoretical:NOTE:Within the context of vulnerability theory, privileges and permissions are two sides of the same coin. Privileges are associated with actors, and permissions are associated with resources. To perform access control, at some point the software makes a decision about whether the actor (and the privileges that have been assigned to that actor) is allowed to access the resource (based on the permissions that have been specified for that resource).::
