# ID: 561 - Dead Code
<h5>Name</h5>Dead Code
<h5>Weakness</h5>Variant
<h5>Status</h5>Draft
<h5>Description</h5>The software contains dead code, which can never be executed.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>Dead code is source code that can never be executed in a running program. The surrounding code makes it impossible for a section of code to ever be executed.
