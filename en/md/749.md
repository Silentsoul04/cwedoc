# ID: 749 - Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
<h5>Name</h5>Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
<h5>Weakness</h5>Base
<h5>Status</h5>Incomplete
<h5>Description</h5>The software provides an Applications Programming Interface (API) or similar interface for interaction with external actors, but the interface includes a dangerous method or function that is not properly restricted.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>This weakness can lead to a wide variety of resultant weaknesses, depending on the behavior of the exposed method. It can apply to any number of technologies and approaches, such as ActiveX controls, Java functions, IOCTLs, and so on. The exposure can occur in a few different ways: 1) The function/method was never intended to be exposed to outside actors. 2) The function/method was only intended to be accessible to a limited set of actors, such as Internet-based access from a single web site.

This could result in the modification or exposure of sensitive data or possibly even execution of arbitrary code.::

<h5>PotentialMitigations</h5>::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:If you must expose a method, make sure to perform input validation on all arguments, limit access to authorized parties, and protect against all possible vulnerabilities.::PHASE:Architecture and Design Implementation:STRATEGY:Attack Surface Reduction:EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Identify all exposed functionality. Explicitly list all functionality that must be exposed to some user or set of users. Identify which functionality may be: accessible to all users restricted to a small set of privileged users prevented from being directly accessible at all Ensure that the implemented code follows these expectations. This includes setting the appropriate access modifiers where applicable (public, private, protected, etc.) or not marking ActiveX controls safe-for-scripting.::

<h5>Notes</h5>TYPE:Research Gap:NOTE:Under-reported and under-studied. This weakness could appear in any technology, language, or framework that allows the programmer to provide a functional interface to external parties, but it is not heavily reported. In 2007, CVE began showing a notable increase in reports of exposed method vulnerabilities in ActiveX applications, as well as IOCTL access to OS-level resources. These weaknesses have been documented for Java applications in various secure programming sources, but there are few reports in CVE, which suggests limited awareness in most parts of the vulnerability research community.::
