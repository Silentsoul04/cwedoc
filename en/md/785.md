# ID: 785 - Use of Path Manipulation Function without Maximum-sized Buffer
<h5>Name</h5>Use of Path Manipulation Function without Maximum-sized Buffer
<h5>Weakness</h5>Variant
<h5>Status</h5>Incomplete
<h5>Description</h5>The software invokes a function for normalizing paths or file names, but it provides an output buffer that is smaller than the maximum possible size, such as PATH_MAX.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>Passing an inadequately-sized output buffer to a path manipulation function can result in a buffer overflow. Such functions include realpath(), readlink(), PathAppend(), and others.

<h5>BackgroundDetails</h5>::Windows provides a large number of utility functions that manipulate buffers containing filenames. In most cases, the result is returned in a buffer that is passed in as input. (Usually the filename is modified in place.) Most functions require the buffer to be at least MAX_PATH bytes in length, but you should check the documentation for each function individually. If the buffer is not large enough to store the result of the manipulation, a buffer overflow can occur.::

<h5>Notes</h5>TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:Much of this entry was originally part of CWE-249, which was deprecated for several reasons.::::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:This entry is at a much lower level of abstraction than most entries because it is function-specific. It also has significant overlap with other entries that can vary depending on the perspective. For example, incorrect usage could trigger either a stack-based overflow (CWE-121) or a heap-based overflow (CWE-122). The CWE team has not decided how to handle such entries.::
