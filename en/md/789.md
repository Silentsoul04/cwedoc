# ID: 789 - Uncontrolled Memory Allocation
<h5>Name</h5>Uncontrolled Memory Allocation
<h5>Weakness</h5>Variant
<h5>Status</h5>Draft
<h5>Description</h5>The product allocates memory based on an untrusted size value, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates the size, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.

<h5>CommonConsequences</h5>::SCOPE:Availability:TECHNICAL IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (Memory):NOTE:Availability DoS: Resource Consumption (Memory) Not controlling memory allocation can result in a request for too much system memory, possibly leading to a crash of the application due to out-of-memory conditions, or the consumption of a large amount of memory on the system.::
<h5>DetectionMethods</h5>null
<h5>PotentialMitigations</h5>::PHASE:Implementation Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Perform adequate input validation against any value that influences the amount of memory that is allocated. Define an appropriate strategy for handling requests that exceed the limit, and consider supporting a configuration option so that the administrator can extend the amount of memory to be used if necessary.::PHASE:Operation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Run your program using system-provided resource limits for memory. This might still cause the program to crash or exit, but the impact to the rest of the system will be minimized.::

<h5>RelatedAttackPatterns</h5>null
<h5>Notes</h5>TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:This weakness can be closely associated with integer overflows (CWE-190). Integer overflow attacks would concentrate on providing an extremely large number that triggers an overflow that causes less memory to be allocated than expected. By providing a large value that does not trigger an integer overflow, the attacker could still cause excessive amounts of memory to be allocated.::::TYPE:Applicable Platform:NOTE:Uncontrolled memory allocation is possible in many languages, such as dynamic array allocation in perl or initial size parameters in Collections in Java. However, languages like C and C++ where programmers have the power to more directly control memory management will be more susceptible.::
