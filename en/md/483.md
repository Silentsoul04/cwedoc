# ID: 483 - Incorrect Block Delimitation
<h5>Name</h5>Incorrect Block Delimitation
<h5>Weakness</h5>Variant
<h5>Status</h5>Draft
<h5>Description</h5>The code does not explicitly delimit a block that is intended to contain 2 or more statements, creating a logic error.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>In some languages, braces (or other delimiters) are optional for blocks. When the delimiter is omitted, it is possible to insert a logic error in which a statement is thought to be in a block but is not. In some cases, the logic error can have security implications.

<h5>CommonConsequences</h5>::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Availability:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Alter Execution Logic:NOTE:Confidentiality Integrity Availability Alter Execution Logic This is a general logic error which will often lead to obviously-incorrect behaviors that are quickly noticed and fixed. In lightly tested or untested code, this error may be introduced it into a production environment and provide additional attack vectors by creating a control flow path leading to an unexpected state in the application. The consequences will depend on the types of behaviors that are being incorrectly executed.::
