# ID: 378 - Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions
<h5>Name</h5>Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions
<h5>Weakness</h5>Base
<h5>Status</h5>Draft

<h5>CommonConsequences</h5>::SCOPE:Confidentiality:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Read Application Data:NOTE:Confidentiality Read Application Data If the temporary file can be read by the attacker, sensitive information may be in that file which could be revealed.::SCOPE:Authorization:SCOPE:Other:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Other:NOTE:Authorization Other Other If that file can be written to by the attacker, the file might be moved into a place to which the attacker does not have access. This will allow the attacker to gain selective resource access-control privileges.::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Other:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Other:NOTE:Integrity Other Other Depending on the data stored in the temporary file, there is the potential for an attacker to gain an additional input vector which is trusted as non-malicious. It may be possible to make arbitrary changes to data structures, user information, or even process ownership.::

<h5>PotentialMitigations</h5>::PHASE:Requirements:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Many contemporary languages have functions which properly handle this condition. Older C temp file functions are especially susceptible.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Ensure that you use proper file permissions. This can be achieved by using a safe temp file function. Temporary files should be writable and readable only by the process that owns the file.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Randomize temporary file names. This can also be achieved by using a safe temp-file function. This will ensure that temporary files will not be created in predictable places.::
