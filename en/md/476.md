# ID: 476 - NULL Pointer Dereference
<h5>Name</h5>NULL Pointer Dereference
<h5>Weakness</h5>Base
<h5>Status</h5>Draft
<h5>Description</h5>A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but is NULL, typically causing a crash or exit.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>NULL pointer dereference issues can occur through a number of flaws, including race conditions, and simple programming omissions.
<h5>RelatedWeaknesses</h5>::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:710:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::
<h5>WeaknessOrdinalities</h5>::ORDINALITY:Resultant:DESCRIPTION:NULL pointer dereferences are frequently resultant from rarely encountered error conditions, since these are most likely to escape detection during the testing phases.::

<h5>CommonConsequences</h5>::SCOPE:Availability:TECHNICAL IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:NOTE:Availability DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart NULL pointer dereferences usually result in the failure of the process unless exception handling (on some platforms) is available and implemented. Even when exception handling is being used, it can still be very difficult to return the software to a safe state of operation.::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Availability:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:NOTE:Integrity Confidentiality Availability Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands In very rare circumstances and environments, code execution is possible.::
<h5>DetectionMethods</h5>::METHOD:Automated Dynamic Analysis:EFFECTIVENESS:Moderate:DESCRIPTION:This weakness can be detected using dynamic tools and techniques that interact with the software using large test suites with many diverse inputs, such as fuzz testing (fuzzing), robustness testing, and fault injection. The software's operation may slow down, but it should not become unstable, crash, or generate incorrect results.::METHOD:Manual Dynamic Analysis:EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Identify error conditions that are not likely to occur during normal usage and trigger them. For example, run the program under low memory conditions, run with insufficient privileges or permissions, interrupt a transaction before it is completed, or disable connectivity to basic network services such as DNS. Monitor the software for any unexpected behavior. If you trigger an unhandled exception or similar error that was discovered and handled by the application's environment, it may still indicate unexpected conditions that were not handled by the application itself.::
<h5>PotentialMitigations</h5>::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:If all pointers that could have been modified are sanity-checked previous to use, nearly all NULL pointer dereferences can be prevented.::PHASE:Requirements:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:The choice could be made to use a language that is not susceptible to these issues.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS:Moderate:DESCRIPTION:Check the results of all functions that return a value and verify that the value is non-null before acting upon it.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Identify all variables and data stores that receive information from external sources, and apply input validation to make sure that they are only initialized to expected values.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Explicitly initialize all your variables and other data stores, either during declaration or just before the first usage.::PHASE:Testing:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Use automated static analysis tools that target this type of weakness. Many modern techniques use data flow analysis to minimize the number of false positives. This is not a perfect solution, since 100% accuracy and coverage are not feasible.::
