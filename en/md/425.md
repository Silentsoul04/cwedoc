# ID: 425 - Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
<h5>Name</h5>Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
<h5>Weakness</h5>Base
<h5>Status</h5>Incomplete
<h5>Description</h5>The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>Web applications susceptible to direct request attacks often make the false assumption that such resources can only be reached through a given navigation path and so only apply authorization at certain points in the path.

<h5>Notes</h5>TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:Overlaps Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID), authorization errors, container errors; often primary to other weaknesses such as XSS and SQL injection.::::TYPE:Theoretical:NOTE:Forced browsing is a step-based manipulation involving the omission of one or more steps, whose order is assumed to be immutable. The application does not verify that the first step was performed successfully before the second step. The consequence is typically authentication bypass or path disclosure, although it can be primary to all kinds of weaknesses, especially in languages such as PHP, which allow external modification of assumed-immutable variables.::
