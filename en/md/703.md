<h5>Notes</h5>TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:This is a high-level class that might have some overlap with other classes. It could be argued that even normal weaknesses such as buffer overflows involve unusual or exceptional conditions. In that sense, this might be an inherent aspect of most other weaknesses within CWE, similar to API Abuse (CWE-227) and Indicator of Poor Code Quality (CWE-398). However, this entry is currently intended to unify disparate concepts that do not have other places within the Research Concepts view (CWE-1000).::
