# ID: 784 - Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision
<h5>Name</h5>Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision
<h5>Weakness</h5>Variant
<h5>Status</h5>Draft
<h5>Description</h5>The application uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of a cookie, but it does not properly ensure that the cookie is valid for the associated user.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>Attackers can easily modify cookies, within the browser or by implementing the client-side code outside of the browser. Attackers can bypass protection mechanisms such as authorization and authentication by modifying the cookie to contain an expected value.

<h5>CommonConsequences</h5>::SCOPE:Access Control:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism Gain Privileges or Assume Identity:NOTE:Access Control Bypass Protection Mechanism Gain Privileges or Assume Identity It is dangerous to use cookies to set a user's privileges. The cookie can be manipulated to claim a high level of authorization, or to claim that successful authentication has occurred.::

<h5>PotentialMitigations</h5>::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Avoid using cookie data for a security-related decision.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Perform thorough input validation (i.e.: server side validation) on the cookie data if you're going to use it for a security related decision.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Add integrity checks to detect tampering.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Protect critical cookies from replay attacks, since cross-site scripting or other attacks may allow attackers to steal a strongly-encrypted cookie that also passes integrity checks. This mitigation applies to cookies that should only be valid during a single transaction or session. By enforcing timeouts, you may limit the scope of an attack. As part of your integrity check, use an unpredictable, server-side value that is not exposed to the client.::

<h5>Notes</h5>TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:A new parent might need to be defined for this entry. This entry is specific to cookies, which reflects the significant number of vulnerabilities being reported for cookie-based authentication in CVE during 2008 and 2009. However, other types of inputs - such as parameters or headers - could also be used for similar authentication or authorization. Similar issues (under the Research view) include CWE-247 and CWE-472.::
