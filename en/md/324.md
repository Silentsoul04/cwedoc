# ID: 324 - Use of a Key Past its Expiration Date
<h5>Name</h5>Use of a Key Past its Expiration Date
<h5>Weakness</h5>Base
<h5>Status</h5>Draft
<h5>Description</h5>The product uses a cryptographic key or password past its expiration date, which diminishes its safety significantly by increasing the timing window for cracking attacks against that key.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>While the expiration of keys does not necessarily ensure that they are compromised, it is a significant concern that keys which remain in use for prolonged periods of time have a decreasing probability of integrity. For this reason, it is important to replace keys within a period of time proportional to their strength.
