# ID: 128 - Wrap-around Error
<h5>Name</h5>Wrap-around Error
<h5>Weakness</h5>Base
<h5>Status</h5>Incomplete
<h5>Description</h5>Wrap around errors occur whenever a value is incremented past the maximum value for its type and therefore wraps around to a very small, negative, or undefined value.

<h5>WeaknessOrdinalities</h5>::ORDINALITY:Primary:DESCRIPTION:::
<h5>ApplicablePlatforms</h5>::LANGUAGE NAME:C:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Often::LANGUAGE NAME:C++:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Often::
<h5>BackgroundDetails</h5>::Due to how addition is performed by computers, if a primitive is incremented past the maximum value possible for its storage space, the system will not recognize this, and therefore increment each bit as if it still had extra space. Because of how negative numbers are represented in binary, primitives interpreted as signed may wrap to very large negative values.::

In the case of overflows involving loop index variables, the likelihood of infinite loops is also high.::SCOPE:Integrity:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Modify Memory:NOTE:Integrity Modify Memory If the value in question is important to data (as opposed to flow), simple data corruption has occurred. Also, if the wrap around results in other conditions such as buffer overflows, further memory corruption may occur.::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Access Control:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands Bypass Protection Mechanism:NOTE:Confidentiality Availability Access Control Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands Bypass Protection Mechanism This weakness can sometimes trigger buffer overflows which can be used to execute arbitrary code. This is usually outside the scope of a program's implicit security policy.::
