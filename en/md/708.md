<h5>Name</h5>Incorrect Ownership Assignment
<h5>Weakness</h5>Base
<h5>Status</h5>Incomplete
<h5>Description</h5>The software assigns an owner to a resource, but the owner is outside of the intended control sphere.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>This may allow the resource to be manipulated by actors outside of the intended control sphere.

<h5>Notes</h5>TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:This overlaps verification errors, permissions, and privileges. A closely related weakness is the incorrect assignment of groups to a resource. It is not clear whether it would fall under this entry or require a different entry.::
