# ID: 488 - Exposure of Data Element to Wrong Session
<h5>Name</h5>Exposure of Data Element to Wrong Session
<h5>Weakness</h5>Variant
<h5>Status</h5>Draft
<h5>Description</h5>The product does not sufficiently enforce boundaries between the states of different sessions, causing data to be provided to, or used by, the wrong session.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>Data can bleed from one session to another through member variables of singleton objects, such as Servlets, and objects from a shared pool. In the case of Servlets, developers sometimes do not understand that, unless a Servlet implements the SingleThreadModel interface, the Servlet is a singleton; there is only one instance of the Servlet, and that single instance is used and re-used to handle multiple requests that are processed simultaneously by different threads. A common result is that developers use Servlet member fields in such a way that one user may inadvertently see another user's data. In other words, storing user data in Servlet member fields introduces a data access race condition.
