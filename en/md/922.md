# ID: 922 - Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information
<h5>Name</h5>Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information
<h5>Weakness</h5>Class
<h5>Status</h5>Incomplete
<h5>Description</h5>The software stores sensitive information without properly limiting read or write access by unauthorized actors.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>If read access is not properly restricted, then attackers can steal the sensitive information. If write access is not properly restricted, then attackers can modify and possibly delete the data, causing incorrect results and possibly a denial of service.

<h5>Notes</h5>TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:There is an overlapping relationship between insecure storage of sensitive information (CWE-922) and missing encryption of sensitive information (CWE-311). Encryption is often used to prevent an attacker from reading the sensitive data. However, encryption does not prevent the attacker from erasing or overwriting the data.::::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:This is a high-level node that includes children from various parts of the CWE research view (CWE-1000). Currently, most of the information is in these child entries. This entry will be made more comprehensive in later CWE versions.::
