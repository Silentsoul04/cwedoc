# ID: 312 - Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
<h5>Name</h5>Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
<h5>Weakness</h5>Variant
<h5>Status</h5>Draft
<h5>Description</h5>The application stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>Because the information is stored in cleartext, attackers could potentially read it. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

<h5>Notes</h5>TYPE:Terminology:NOTE:Different people use cleartext and plaintext to mean the same thing: the lack of encryption. However, within cryptography, these have more precise meanings. Plaintext is the information just before it is fed into a cryptographic algorithm, including already-encrypted text. Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-readable (such as base64 encoding).::
