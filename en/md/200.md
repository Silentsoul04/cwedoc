# ID: 200 - Information Exposure
<h5>Name</h5>Information Exposure
<h5>Weakness</h5>Class
<h5>Status</h5>Incomplete
<h5>Description</h5>An information exposure is the intentional or unintentional disclosure of information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>The information either is regarded as sensitive within the product's own functionality, such as a private message; or provides information about the product or its environment that could be useful in an attack but is normally not available to the attacker, such as the installation path of a product that is remotely accessible. Many information exposures are resultant (e.g. PHP script error revealing the full path of the program), but they can also be primary (e.g. timing discrepancies in cryptography). There are many different types of problems that involve information exposures. Their severity can range widely depending on the type of information that is revealed.

<h5>AlternateTerms</h5>::TERM:Information Leak:DESCRIPTION:This is a frequently used term, however the leak term has multiple uses within security. In some cases it deals with exposure of information, but in other cases (such as memory leak) this deals with improper tracking of resources which can lead to exhaustion. As a result, CWE is actively avoiding usage of the leak term.::TERM:Information Disclosure:DESCRIPTION:This term is frequently used in vulnerability databases and other sources, however disclosure does not always have security implications. The phrase information disclosure is also used frequently in policies and legal documents, but do not refer to disclosure of security-relevant information.::

<h5>PotentialMitigations</h5>::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Separation of Privilege:EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Compartmentalize the system to have safe areas where trust boundaries can be unambiguously drawn. Do not allow sensitive data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area. Ensure that appropriate compartmentalization is built into the system design and that the compartmentalization serves to allow for and further reinforce privilege separation functionality. Architects and designers should rely on the principle of least privilege to decide when it is appropriate to use and to drop system privileges.::
