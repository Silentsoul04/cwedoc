# ID: 407 - Algorithmic Complexity
<h5>Name</h5>Algorithmic Complexity
<h5>Weakness</h5>Base
<h5>Status</h5>Incomplete
<h5>Description</h5>An algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.
