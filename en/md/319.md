# ID: 319 - Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
<h5>Name</h5>Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
<h5>Weakness</h5>Variant
<h5>Status</h5>Draft
<h5>Description</h5>The software transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>Many communication channels can be sniffed by attackers during data transmission. For example, network traffic can often be sniffed by any attacker who has access to a network interface. This significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by attackers.

<h5>DetectionMethods</h5>::METHOD:Black Box:EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Use monitoring tools that examine the software's process as it interacts with the operating system and the network. This technique is useful in cases when source code is unavailable, if the software was not developed by you, or if you want to verify that the build phase did not introduce any new weaknesses. Examples include debuggers that directly attach to the running process; system-call tracing utilities such as truss (Solaris) and strace (Linux); system activity monitors such as FileMon, RegMon, Process Monitor, and other Sysinternals utilities (Windows); and sniffers and protocol analyzers that monitor network traffic. Attach the monitor to the process, trigger the feature that sends the data, and look for the presence or absence of common cryptographic functions in the call tree. Monitor the network and determine if the data packets contain readable commands. Tools exist for detecting if certain encodings are in use. If the traffic contains high entropy, this might indicate the usage of encryption.::
<h5>PotentialMitigations</h5>::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Encrypt the data with a reliable encryption scheme before transmitting.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:When using web applications with SSL, use SSL for the entire session from login to logout, not just for the initial login page.::PHASE:Testing:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Use tools and techniques that require manual (human) analysis, such as penetration testing, threat modeling, and interactive tools that allow the tester to record and modify an active session. These may be more effective than strictly automated techniques. This is especially the case with weaknesses that are related to design and business rules.::PHASE:Operation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Configure servers to use encrypted channels for communication, which may include SSL or other secure protocols.::
