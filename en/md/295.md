# ID: 295 - Improper Certificate Validation
<h5>Name</h5>Improper Certificate Validation
<h5>Weakness</h5>Base
<h5>Status</h5>Incomplete
<h5>Description</h5>The software does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>When a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by using a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. The software might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the software might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host.

<h5>PotentialMitigations</h5>::PHASE:Architecture and Design Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Certificates should be carefully managed and checked to assure that data are encrypted with the intended owner's public key.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:If certificate pinning is being used, ensure that all relevant properties of the certificate are fully validated before the certificate is pinned, including the hostname.::
