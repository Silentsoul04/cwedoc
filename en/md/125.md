# ID: 125 - Out-of-bounds Read
<h5>Name</h5>Out-of-bounds Read
<h5>Weakness</h5>Base
<h5>Status</h5>Draft
<h5>Description</h5>The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>Typically, this can allow attackers to read sensitive information from other memory locations or cause a crash. A crash can occur when the code reads a variable amount of data and assumes that a sentinel exists to stop the read operation, such as a NUL in a string. The expected sentinel might not be located in the out-of-bounds memory, causinfg excessive data to be read, leading to a segmentation fault or a buffer overflow. The software may modify an index or perform pointer arithmetic that references a memory location that is outside of the boundaries of the buffer. A subsequent read operation then produces undefined or unexpected results.
