# ID: 493 - Critical Public Variable Without Final Modifier
<h5>Name</h5>Critical Public Variable Without Final Modifier
<h5>Weakness</h5>Variant
<h5>Status</h5>Draft
<h5>Description</h5>The product has a critical public variable that is not final, which allows the variable to be modified to contain unexpected values.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>If a field is non-final and public, it can be changed once the value is set by any function that has access to the class which contains the field. This could lead to a vulnerability if other parts of the program make assumptions about the contents of that field.

<h5>BackgroundDetails</h5>::Mobile code, such as a Java Applet, is code that is transmitted across a network and executed on a remote machine. Because mobile code developers have little if any control of the environment in which their code will execute, special security concerns become relevant. One of the biggest environmental threats results from the risk that the mobile code will run side-by-side with other, potentially malicious, mobile code. Because all of the popular web browsers execute code from multiple sources together in the same JVM, many of the security guidelines for mobile code are focused on preventing manipulation of your objects' state and behavior by adversaries who have access to the same virtual machine where your program is running.::Final provides security by only allowing non-mutable objects to be changed after being set. However, only objects which are not extended can be made final.::

<h5>PotentialMitigations</h5>::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Declare all public fields as final when possible, especially if it is used to maintain internal state of an Applet or of classes used by an Applet. If a field must be public, then perform all appropriate sanity checks before accessing the field from your code.::
