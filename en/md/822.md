# ID: 822 - Untrusted Pointer Dereference
<h5>Name</h5>Untrusted Pointer Dereference
<h5>Weakness</h5>Base
<h5>Status</h5>Incomplete
<h5>Description</h5>The program obtains a value from an untrusted source, converts this value to a pointer, and dereferences the resulting pointer.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>An attacker can supply a pointer for memory locations that the program is not expecting. If the pointer is dereferenced for a write operation, the attack might allow modification of critical program state variables, cause a crash, or execute code. If the dereferencing operation is for a read, then the attack might allow reading of sensitive data, cause a crash, or set a program variable to an unexpected value (since the value will be read from an unexpected memory location). There are several variants of this weakness, including but not necessarily limited to: The untrusted value is directly invoked as a function call. In OS kernels or drivers where there is a boundary between userland and privileged memory spaces, an untrusted pointer might enter through an API or system call (see CWE-781 for one such example). Inadvertently accepting the value from an untrusted control sphere when it did not have to be accepted as input at all. This might occur when the code was originally developed to be run by a single user in a non-networked environment, and the code is then ported to or otherwise exposed to a networked environment.

However, the bug ID says contents are simply interpreted as a pointer... renderer ordinarily doesn't supply this pointer directly.

<h5>Notes</h5>TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.::::TYPE:Terminology:NOTE:Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of memory corruption or memory safety. As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.::::TYPE:Research Gap:NOTE:Under-studied and probably under-reported as of September 2010. This weakness has been reported in high-visibility software, but applied vulnerability researchers have only been investigating it since approximately 2008, and there are only a few public reports. Few reports identify weaknesses at such a low level, which makes it more difficult to find and study real-world code examples.::
