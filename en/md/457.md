# ID: 457 - Use of Uninitialized Variable
<h5>Name</h5>Use of Uninitialized Variable
<h5>Weakness</h5>Variant
<h5>Status</h5>Draft
<h5>Description</h5>The code uses a variable that has not been initialized, leading to unpredictable or unintended results.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>In some languages such as C and C++, stack variables are not initialized by default. They generally contain junk data with the contents of stack memory before the function was invoked. An attacker can sometimes control or read these contents. In other languages or conditions, a variable that is not explicitly initialized can be given a default value that has security implications, depending on the logic of the program. The presence of an uninitialized variable can sometimes indicate a typographic error in the code.

<h5>CommonConsequences</h5>::SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Other:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Other:NOTE:Availability Integrity Other Other Initial variables usually contain junk, which can not be trusted for consistency. This can lead to denial of service conditions, or modify control flow in unexpected ways. In some cases, an attacker can pre-initialize the variable using previous actions, which might enable code execution. This can cause a race condition if a lock variable check passes when it should not.::SCOPE:Authorization:SCOPE:Other:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Other:NOTE:Authorization Other Other Strings that are not initialized are especially dangerous, since many functions expect a null at the end -- and only at the end -- of a string.::

This may indicate the presence of a typographic error in the variable's name.::PHASE:Requirements:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:The choice could be made to use a language that is not susceptible to these issues.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Mitigating technologies such as safe string libraries and container abstractions could be introduced.::
