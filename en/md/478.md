# ID: 478 - Missing Default Case in Switch Statement
<h5>Name</h5>Missing Default Case in Switch Statement
<h5>Weakness</h5>Variant
<h5>Status</h5>Draft
<h5>Description</h5>The code does not have a default case in a switch statement, which might lead to complex logical errors and resultant weaknesses.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>This flaw represents a common problem in software development, in which not all possible values for a variable are considered or handled by a given process. Because of this, further decisions are made based on poor information, and cascading failure results. This cascading failure may result in any number of security issues, and constitutes a significant failure in the system.

<h5>PotentialMitigations</h5>::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Ensure that there are no unaccounted for cases, when adjusting flow or values based on the value of a given variable. In switch statements, this can be accomplished through the use of the default label.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:In the case of switch style statements, the very simple act of creating a default case can mitigate this situation, if done correctly. Often however, the default case is used simply to represent an assumed option, as opposed to working as a check for invalid input. This is poor practice and in some cases is as bad as omitting a default case entirely.::
