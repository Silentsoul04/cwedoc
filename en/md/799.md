# ID: 799 - Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
<h5>Name</h5>Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
<h5>Weakness</h5>Class
<h5>Status</h5>Incomplete
<h5>Description</h5>The software does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>This can allow the actor to perform actions more frequently than expected. The actor could be a human or an automated process such as a virus or bot. This could be used to cause a denial of service, compromise program logic (such as limiting humans to a single vote), or other consequences. For example, an authentication routine might not limit the number of times an attacker can guess a password. Or, a web site might conduct a poll but only expect humans to vote a maximum of once a day.
