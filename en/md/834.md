# ID: 834 - Excessive Iteration
<h5>Name</h5>Excessive Iteration
<h5>Weakness</h5>Base
<h5>Status</h5>Incomplete
<h5>Description</h5>The software performs an iteration or loop without sufficiently limiting the number of times that the loop is executed.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>If the iteration can be influenced by an attacker, this weakness could allow attackers to consume excessive resources such as CPU or memory. In many cases, a loop does not need to be infinite in order to cause enough resource consumption to adversely affect the software or its host system; it depends on the amount of resources consumed per iteration.

The software's operation may slow down, or cause a long time to respond. If limited resources such as memory are consumed for each iteration, the loop may eventually cause a crash or program exit due to exhaustion of resources, such as an out-of-memory error.::
