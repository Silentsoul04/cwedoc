# ID: 477 - Use of Obsolete Function
<h5>Name</h5>Use of Obsolete Function
<h5>Weakness</h5>Base
<h5>Status</h5>Draft
<h5>Description</h5>The code uses deprecated or obsolete functions, which suggests that the code has not been actively reviewed or maintained.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>As programming languages evolve, functions occasionally become obsolete due to: Advances in the language Improved understanding of how operations should be performed effectively and securely Changes in the conventions that govern certain operations Functions that are removed are usually replaced by newer counterparts that perform the same task in some different and hopefully improved way.
