# ID: 187 - Partial String Comparison
<h5>Name</h5>Partial String Comparison
<h5>Weakness</h5>Variant
<h5>Status</h5>Incomplete
<h5>Description</h5>The software performs a comparison that only examines a portion of a factor before determining whether there is a match, such as a substring, leading to resultant weaknesses.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>For example, an attacker might succeed in authentication by providing a small password that matches the associated portion of the larger, correct password.
