# ID: 170 - Improper Null Termination
<h5>Name</h5>Improper Null Termination
<h5>Weakness</h5>Base
<h5>Status</h5>Incomplete
<h5>Description</h5>The software does not terminate or incorrectly terminates a string or array with a null character or equivalent terminator.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>Null termination errors frequently occur in two different ways. An off-by-one error could cause a null to be written out of bounds, leading to an overflow. Or, a program could use a strncpy() function call incorrectly, which prevents a null terminator from being added at all. Other scenarios are possible.

<h5>CommonConsequences</h5>::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Availability:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Read Memory Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:NOTE:Confidentiality Integrity Availability Read Memory Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands The case of an omitted null character is the most dangerous of the possible issues. This will almost certainly result in information disclosure, and possibly a buffer overflow condition, which may be exploited to execute arbitrary code.::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Availability:TECHNICAL IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart Read Memory DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU) DoS: Resource Consumption (Memory):NOTE:Confidentiality Integrity Availability DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart Read Memory DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU) DoS: Resource Consumption (Memory) If a null character is omitted from a string, then most string-copying functions will read data until they locate a null character, even outside of the intended boundaries of the string. This could: cause a crash due to a segmentation fault cause sensitive adjacent memory to be copied and sent to an outsider trigger a buffer overflow when the copy is being written to a fixed-size buffer::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Availability:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Modify Memory DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:NOTE:Integrity Availability Modify Memory DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart Misplaced null characters may result in any number of security problems. The biggest issue is a subset of buffer overflow, and write-what-where conditions, where data corruption occurs from the writing of a null character over valid data, or even instructions. A randomly placed null character may put the system into an undefined state, and therefore make it prone to crashing. A misplaced null character may corrupt other data in memory.::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Access Control:SCOPE:Other:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Alter Execution Logic Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:NOTE:Integrity Confidentiality Availability Access Control Other Alter Execution Logic Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands Should the null character corrupt the process flow, or affect a flag controlling access, it may lead to logical errors which allow for the execution of arbitrary code.::

<h5>PotentialMitigations</h5>::PHASE:Requirements:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Use a language that is not susceptible to these issues. However, be careful of null byte interaction errors (CWE-626) with lower-level constructs that may be written in a language that is susceptible.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Ensure that all string functions used are understood fully as to how they append null characters. Also, be wary of off-by-one errors when appending nulls to the end of strings.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:If performance constraints permit, special code can be added that validates null-termination of string buffers, this is a rather naive and error-prone solution.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Switch to bounded string manipulation functions. Inspect buffer lengths involved in the buffer overrun trace reported with the defect.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Add code that fills buffers with nulls (however, the length of buffers still needs to be inspected, to ensure that the non null-terminated string is not written at the physical end of the buffer).::

<h5>Notes</h5>TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:Factors: this is usually resultant from other weaknesses such as off-by-one errors, but it can be primary to boundary condition violations such as buffer overflows. In buffer overflows, it can act as an expander for assumed-immutable data.::::TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:Overlaps missing input terminator.::::TYPE:Applicable Platform:NOTE:Conceptually, this does not just apply to the C language; any language or representation that involves a terminator could have this type of problem.::::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:As currently described, this entry is more like a category than a weakness.::
