# ID: 925 - Improper Verification of Intent by Broadcast Receiver
<h5>Name</h5>Improper Verification of Intent by Broadcast Receiver
<h5>Weakness</h5>Variant
<h5>Status</h5>Incomplete
<h5>Description</h5>The Android application uses a Broadcast Receiver that receives an Intent but does not properly verify that the Intent came from an authorized source.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>Certain types of Intents, identified by action string, can only be broadcast by the operating system itself, not by third-party applications. However, when an application registers to receive these implicit system intents, it is also registered to receive any explicit intents. While a malicious application cannot send an implicit system intent, it can send an explicit intent to the target application, which may assume that any received intent is a valid implicit system intent and not an explicit intent from another application. This may lead to unintended behavior.
