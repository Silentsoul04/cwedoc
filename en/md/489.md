# ID: 489 - Leftover Debug Code
<h5>Name</h5>Leftover Debug Code
<h5>Weakness</h5>Base
<h5>Status</h5>Draft
<h5>Description</h5>The application can be deployed with active debugging code that can create unintended entry points.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>A common development practice is to add back door code specifically designed for debugging or testing purposes that is not intended to be shipped or deployed with the application. These back door entry points create security risks because they are not considered during design or testing and fall outside of the expected operating conditions of the application.

At the least, it will give an attacker sensitive information about the settings and mechanics of web applications on the server. At worst, as is often the case, the debug application will allow an attacker complete control over the web application and server, as well as confidential information that either of these access.::
