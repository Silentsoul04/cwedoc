# ID: 832 - Unlock of a Resource that is not Locked
<h5>Name</h5>Unlock of a Resource that is not Locked
<h5>Weakness</h5>Base
<h5>Status</h5>Incomplete
<h5>Description</h5>The software attempts to unlock a resource that is not locked.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>Depending on the locking functionality, an unlock of a non-locked resource might cause memory corruption or other modification to the resource (or its associated metadata that is used for tracking locks).

When effects exist, the most common consequence will be a corruption of the state of the software, possibly leading to a crash or exit; depending on the implementation of the unlocking, memory corruption or code execution could occur.::
