# ID: 470 - Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection')
<h5>Name</h5>Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection')
<h5>Weakness</h5>Base
<h5>Status</h5>Draft
<h5>Description</h5>The application uses external input with reflection to select which classes or code to use, but it does not sufficiently prevent the input from selecting improper classes or code.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>If the application uses external inputs to determine which class to instantiate or which method to invoke, then an attacker could supply values to select unexpected classes or methods. If this occurs, then the attacker could create control flow paths that were not intended by the developer. These paths could bypass authentication or access control checks, or otherwise cause the application to behave in an unexpected manner. This situation becomes a doomsday scenario if the attacker can upload files into a location that appears on the application's classpath (CWE-427) or add new entries to the application's classpath (CWE-426). Under either of these conditions, the attacker can use reflection to introduce new, malicious behavior into the application.

Alternately, the attacker could call unexpected code in the wrong place or the wrong time, possibly modifying critical system state.::SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Other:TECHNICAL IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart Other:NOTE:Availability Other DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart Other The attacker might be able to use reflection to call the wrong code, possibly with unexpected arguments that violate the API (CWE-227). This could cause the application to exit or hang.::SCOPE:Confidentiality:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Read Application Data:NOTE:Confidentiality Read Application Data By causing the wrong code to be invoked, the attacker might be able to trigger a runtime error that leaks sensitive information in the error message, such as CWE-536.::
