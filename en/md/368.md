# ID: 368 - Context Switching Race Condition
<h5>Name</h5>Context Switching Race Condition
<h5>Weakness</h5>Base
<h5>Status</h5>Draft
<h5>Description</h5>A product performs a series of non-atomic actions to switch between contexts that cross privilege or other security boundaries, but a race condition allows an attacker to modify or misrepresent the product's behavior during the switch.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>This is commonly seen in web browser vulnerabilities in which the attacker can perform certain actions while the browser is transitioning from a trusted to an untrusted domain, or vice versa, and the browser performs the actions on one domain using the trust level and resources of the other domain.

<h5>WeaknessOrdinalities</h5>::ORDINALITY:Primary:DESCRIPTION:This weakness can be primary to almost anything, depending on the context of the race condition.::ORDINALITY:Resultant:DESCRIPTION:This weakness can be resultant from insufficient compartmentalization (CWE-653), incorrect locking, improper initialization or shutdown, or a number of other weaknesses.::

<h5>ObservedExamples</h5>::REFERENCE:CVE-2009-1837:DESCRIPTION:Chain: race condition (CWE-362) from improper handling of a page transition in web client while an applet is loading (CWE-368) leads to use after free (CWE-416):LINK:https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1837REFERENCE:CVE-2004-2260:DESCRIPTION:Browser updates address bar as soon as user clicks on a link instead of when the page has loaded, allowing spoofing by redirecting to another page using onUnload method. ** this is one example of the role of hooks and context switches, and should be captured somehow - also a race condition of sorts **:LINK:https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2004-2260REFERENCE:CVE-2004-0191:DESCRIPTION:XSS when web browser executes Javascript events in the context of a new page while it's being loaded, allowing interaction with previous page in different domain.:LINK:https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2004-0191REFERENCE:CVE-2004-2491:DESCRIPTION:Web browser fills in address bar of clicked-on link before page has been loaded, and doesn't update afterward.:LINK:https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2004-2491
