# ID: 788 - Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer
<h5>Name</h5>Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer
<h5>Weakness</h5>Base
<h5>Status</h5>Incomplete
<h5>Description</h5>The software reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>This typically occurs when a pointer or its index is decremented to a position before the buffer; when pointer arithmetic results in a position before the buffer; or when a negative index is used, which generates a position before the buffer.

<h5>CommonConsequences</h5>::SCOPE:Confidentiality:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Read Memory:NOTE:Confidentiality Read Memory For an out-of-bounds read, the attacker may have access to sensitive information. If the sensitive information contains system details, such as the current buffers position in memory, this knowledge can be used to craft further attacks, possibly with more severe consequences.::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Availability:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Modify Memory DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:NOTE:Integrity Availability Modify Memory DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart Out of bounds memory access will very likely result in the corruption of relevant memory, and perhaps instructions, possibly leading to a crash. Other attacks leading to lack of availability are possible, including putting the program into an infinite loop.::SCOPE:Integrity:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Modify Memory Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:NOTE:Integrity Modify Memory Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands If the memory accessible by the attacker can be effectively controlled, it may be possible to execute arbitrary code, as with a standard buffer overflow. If the attacker can overwrite a pointer's worth of memory (usually 32 or 64 bits), they can redirect a function pointer to their own malicious code. Even when the attacker can only modify a single byte arbitrary code execution can be possible. Sometimes this is because the same problem can be exploited repeatedly to the same effect. Other times it is because the attacker can overwrite security-critical application-specific data -- such as a flag indicating whether the user is an administrator.::
