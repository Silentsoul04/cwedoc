# ID: 837 - Improper Enforcement of a Single, Unique Action
<h5>Name</h5>Improper Enforcement of a Single, Unique Action
<h5>Weakness</h5>Base
<h5>Status</h5>Incomplete
<h5>Description</h5>The software requires that an actor should only be able to perform an action once, or to have only one unique action, but the software does not enforce or improperly enforces this restriction.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>In various applications, a user is only expected to perform a certain action once, such as voting, requesting a refund, or making a purchase. When this restriction is not enforced, sometimes this can have security implications. For example, in a voting application, an attacker could attempt to stuff the ballot box by voting multiple times. If these votes are counted separately, then the attacker could directly affect who wins the vote. This could have significant business impact depending on the purpose of the software.
