# ID: 772 - Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime
<h5>Name</h5>Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime
<h5>Weakness</h5>Base
<h5>Status</h5>Incomplete
<h5>Description</h5>The software does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, i.e., after the resource is no longer needed.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>When a resource is not released after use, it can allow attackers to cause a denial of service.

<h5>PotentialMitigations</h5>::PHASE:Requirements:STRATEGY:Language Selection:EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid. For example, languages such as Java, Ruby, and Lisp perform automatic garbage collection that releases memory for objects that have been deallocated.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:It is good practice to be responsible for freeing all resources you allocate and to be consistent with how and where you free resources in a function. If you allocate resources that you intend to free upon completion of the function, you must be sure to free the resources at all exit points for that function including error conditions.::PHASE:Operation Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Resource Limitation:EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Use resource-limiting settings provided by the operating system or environment. For example, when managing system resources in POSIX, setrlimit() can be used to set limits for certain types of resources, and getrlimit() can determine how many resources are available. However, these functions are not available on all operating systems. When the current levels get close to the maximum that is defined for the application (see CWE-770), then limit the allocation of further resources to privileged users; alternately, begin releasing resources for less-privileged users. While this mitigation may protect the system from attack, it will not necessarily stop attackers from adversely impacting other users. Ensure that the application performs the appropriate error checks and error handling in case resources become unavailable (CWE-703).::

<h5>Notes</h5>TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:Resource exhaustion (CWE-400) is currently treated as a weakness, although it is more like a category of weaknesses that all have the same type of consequence. While this entry treats CWE-400 as a parent in view 1000, the relationship is probably more appropriately described as a chain.::::TYPE:Theoretical:NOTE:Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. Resource exhaustion can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.::
