# ID: 940 - Improper Verification of Source of a Communication Channel
<h5>Name</h5>Improper Verification of Source of a Communication Channel
<h5>Weakness</h5>Base
<h5>Status</h5>Incomplete
<h5>Description</h5>The software establishes a communication channel to handle an incoming request that has been initiated by an actor, but it does not properly verify that the request is coming from the expected origin.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>When an attacker can successfully establish a communication channel from an untrusted origin, the attacker may be able to gain privileges and access unexpected functionality.

<h5>DetectionMethods</h5>null
<h5>PotentialMitigations</h5>::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Use a mechanism that can validate the identity of the source, such as a certificate, and validate the integrity of data to ensure that it cannot be modified in transit using a man-in-the-middle attack. When designing functionality of actions in the URL scheme, consider whether the action should be accessible to all mobile applications, or if a whitelist of applications to interface with is appropriate.::

<h5>Notes</h5>TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:While many access control issues involve authenticating the user, this weakness is more about authenticating the actual source of the communication channel itself; there might not be any user in such cases.::
