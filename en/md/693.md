# ID: 693 - Protection Mechanism Failure
<h5>Name</h5>Protection Mechanism Failure
<h5>Weakness</h5>Class
<h5>Status</h5>Draft
<h5>Description</h5>The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>This weakness covers three distinct situations. A missing protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An insufficient protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an ignored mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path.

<h5>Notes</h5>TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:This is a fairly high-level concept, although it covers a number of weaknesses in CWE that were more scattered throughout the natural hierarchy before Draft 9 was released.::::TYPE:Research Gap:NOTE:The concept of protection mechanisms is well established, but protection mechanism failures have not been studied comprehensively. It is suspected that protection mechanisms can have significantly different types of weaknesses than the weaknesses that they are intended to prevent.::
