# ID: 196 - Unsigned to Signed Conversion Error
<h5>Name</h5>Unsigned to Signed Conversion Error
<h5>Weakness</h5>Variant
<h5>Status</h5>Draft
<h5>Description</h5>The software uses an unsigned primitive and performs a cast to a signed primitive, which can produce an unexpected value if the value of the unsigned primitive can not be represented using a signed primitive.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>Although less frequent an issue than signed-to-unsigned conversion, unsigned-to-signed conversion can be the perfect precursor to dangerous buffer underwrite conditions that allow attackers to move down the stack where they otherwise might not have access in a normal buffer overflow condition. Buffer underwrites occur frequently when large unsigned values are cast to signed values, and then used as indexes into a buffer or for pointer arithmetic.

<h5>CommonConsequences</h5>::SCOPE:Availability:TECHNICAL IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:NOTE:Availability DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart Incorrect sign conversions generally lead to undefined behavior, and therefore crashes.::SCOPE:Integrity:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Modify Memory:NOTE:Integrity Modify Memory If a poor cast lead to a buffer overflow or similar condition, data integrity may be affected.::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Access Control:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands Bypass Protection Mechanism:NOTE:Integrity Confidentiality Availability Access Control Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands Bypass Protection Mechanism Improper signed-to-unsigned conversions without proper checking can sometimes trigger buffer overflows which can be used to execute arbitrary code. This is usually outside the scope of a program's implicit security policy.::

<h5>PotentialMitigations</h5>::PHASE:Requirements:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Choose a language which is not subject to these casting flaws.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Design object accessor functions to implicitly check values for valid sizes. Ensure that all functions which will be used as a size are checked previous to use as a size. If the language permits, throw exceptions rather than using in-band errors.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Error check the return values of all functions. Be aware of implicit casts made, and use unsigned variables for sizes if at all possible.::
