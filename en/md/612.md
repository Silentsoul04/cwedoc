# ID: 612 - Information Exposure Through Indexing of Private Data
<h5>Name</h5>Information Exposure Through Indexing of Private Data
<h5>Weakness</h5>Variant
<h5>Status</h5>Draft
<h5>Description</h5>The product performs an indexing routine against private documents, but does not sufficiently verify that the actors who can access the index also have the privileges to access the private documents.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>When an indexing routine is applied against a group of private documents, and that index's results are available to outsiders who do not have access to those documents, then outsiders might be able to obtain sensitive information by conducting targeted searches. The risk is especially dangerous if search results include surrounding text that was not part of the search query. This issue can appear in search engines that are not configured (or implemented) to ignore critical files that should remain hidden; even without permissions to download these files directly, the remote user could read them.
