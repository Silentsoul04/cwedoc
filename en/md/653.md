# ID: 653 - Insufficient Compartmentalization
<h5>Name</h5>Insufficient Compartmentalization
<h5>Weakness</h5>Base
<h5>Status</h5>Draft
<h5>Description</h5>The product does not sufficiently compartmentalize functionality or processes that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>When a weakness occurs in functionality that is accessible by lower-privileged users, then without strong boundaries, an attack might extend the scope of the damage to higher-privileged users.

<h5>AlternateTerms</h5>::TERM:Separation of Privilege:DESCRIPTION:Some people and publications use the term Separation of Privilege to describe this weakness, but this term has dual meanings in current usage. This node conflicts with the original definition of Separation of Privilege by Saltzer and Schroeder; that original definition is more closely associated with CWE-654. Because there are multiple interpretations, use of the Separation of Privilege term is discouraged.::

<h5>Notes</h5>TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:There is a close association with CWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges). CWE-653 is about providing separate components for each privilege; CWE-250 is about ensuring that each component has the least amount of privileges possible. In this fashion, compartmentalization becomes one mechanism for reducing privileges.::::TYPE:Terminology:NOTE:The term Separation of Privilege is used in several different ways in the industry, but they generally combine two closely related principles: compartmentalization (this node) and using only one factor in a security decision (CWE-654). Proper compartmentalization implicitly introduces multiple factors into a security decision, but there can be cases in which multiple factors are required for authentication or other mechanisms that do not involve compartmentalization, such as performing all required checks on a submitted certificate. It is likely that CWE-653 and CWE-654 will provoke further discussion.::
