# ID: 564 - SQL Injection: Hibernate
<h5>Name</h5>SQL Injection: Hibernate
<h5>Weakness</h5>Variant
<h5>Status</h5>Incomplete
<h5>Description</h5>Using Hibernate to execute a dynamic SQL statement built with user-controlled input can allow an attacker to modify the statement's meaning or to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

<h5>PotentialMitigations</h5>::PHASE:Requirements:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:A non-SQL style database which is not subject to this flaw may be chosen.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Follow the principle of least privilege when creating user accounts to a SQL database. Users should only have the minimum privileges necessary to use their account. If the requirements of the system indicate that a user can read and modify their own data, then limit their privileges so they cannot read/write others' data.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Implement SQL strings using prepared statements that bind variables. Prepared statements that do not bind variables can be vulnerable to attack.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Use vigorous whitelist style checking on any user input that may be used in a SQL command. Rather than escape meta-characters, it is safest to disallow them entirely. Reason: Later use of data that have been entered in the database may neglect to escape meta-characters before use. Narrowly define the set of safe characters based on the expected value of the parameter in the request.::
