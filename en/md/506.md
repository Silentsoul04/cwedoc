# ID: 506 - Embedded Malicious Code
<h5>Name</h5>Embedded Malicious Code
<h5>Weakness</h5>Class
<h5>Status</h5>Incomplete
<h5>Description</h5>The application contains code that appears to be malicious in nature.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>Malicious flaws have acquired colorful names, including Trojan horse, trapdoor, timebomb, and logic-bomb. A developer might insert malicious code with the intent to subvert the security of an application or its host system at some time in the future. It generally refers to a program that performs a useful service but exploits rights of the program's user in a way the user does not intend.

<h5>PotentialMitigations</h5>::PHASE:Testing:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Remove the malicious code and start an effort to ensure that no more malicious code exists. This may require a detailed review of all code, as it is possible to hide a serious attack in only one or two lines of code. These lines may be located almost anywhere in an application and may have been intentionally obfuscated by the attacker.::
