# ID: 757 - Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')
<h5>Name</h5>Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')
<h5>Weakness</h5>Class
<h5>Status</h5>Incomplete
<h5>Description</h5>A protocol or its implementation supports interaction between multiple actors and allows those actors to negotiate which algorithm should be used as a protection mechanism such as encryption or authentication, but it does not select the strongest algorithm that is available to both parties.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>When a security mechanism can be forced to downgrade to use a less secure algorithm, this can make it easier for attackers to compromise the software by exploiting weaker algorithm. The victim might not be aware that the less secure algorithm is being used. For example, if an attacker can force a communications channel to use cleartext instead of strongly-encrypted data, then the attacker could read the channel by sniffing, instead of going through extra effort of trying to decrypt the data using brute force techniques.
