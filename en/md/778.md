# ID: 778 - Insufficient Logging
<h5>Name</h5>Insufficient Logging
<h5>Weakness</h5>Base
<h5>Status</h5>Draft
<h5>Description</h5>When a security-critical event occurs, the software either does not record the event or omits important details about the event when logging it.
<h5>ExtendedDescription</h5>When security-critical events are not logged properly, such as a failed login attempt, this can make malicious behavior more difficult to detect and may hinder forensic analysis after an attack succeeds.

<h5>CommonConsequences</h5>::SCOPE:Non-Repudiation:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Hide Activities:NOTE:Non-Repudiation Hide Activities If security critical information is not recorded, there will be no trail for forensic analysis and discovering the cause of problems or the source of attacks may become more difficult or impossible.::

<h5>PotentialMitigations</h5>::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Use a centralized logging mechanism that supports multiple levels of detail. Ensure that all security-related successes and failures can be logged.::PHASE:Operation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Be sure to set the level of logging appropriately in a production environment. Sufficient data should be logged to enable system administrators to detect attacks, diagnose errors, and recover from attacks. At the same time, logging too much data (CWE-779) can cause the same problems.::
