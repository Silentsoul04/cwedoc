<h5>Notes</h5>TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:This is a general class of weakness, but most research is focused on more specialized cases, such as path traversal (CWE-22) and symlink following (CWE-61). A symbolic link has a name; in general, it appears like any other file in the file system. However, the link includes a reference to another file, often in another directory - perhaps in another sphere of control. Many common library functions that accept filenames will follow a symbolic link and use the link's target instead.::::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:The relationship between CWE-99 and CWE-610 needs further investigation and clarification. They might be duplicates. CWE-99 Resource Injection, as originally defined in Seven Pernicious Kingdoms taxonomy, emphasizes the identifier used to access a system resource such as a file name or port number, yet it explicitly states that the resource injection term does not apply to path manipulation, which effectively identifies the path at which a resource can be found and could be considered to be one aspect of a resource identifier. Also, CWE-610 effectively covers any type of resource, whether that resource is at the system layer, the application layer, or the code layer.::
